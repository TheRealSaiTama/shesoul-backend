# Database Connection Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the deployment logs, two main issues were causing problems:

1. **"Max client connections reached"** - Database connection pool was exhausted
2. **"'AsyncSession' object has no attribute 'query'"** - Code was mixing async and sync SQLAlchemy patterns

## Root Causes

1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: The original configuration used `pool_size=5` and `max_overflow=10`, which could exceed database connection limits in production.

2. **Async/Sync Pattern Mismatch**: The codebase was using synchronous SQLAlchemy patterns (`db.query()`) with async sessions (`AsyncSession`), which is not supported.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Configuration (`core/database.py`)

- **Reduced connection pool size**: `pool_size=3` (from 5) and `max_overflow=5` (from 10)
- **Added connection timeout**: `pool_timeout=30` seconds
- **Created hybrid approach**: Both async and sync engines for different use cases
- **Added retry logic**: Exponential backoff for connection failures
- **Better error handling**: Specific handling for `OperationalError` and `DisconnectionError`

### 2. Session Management

- **`get_db()`**: Async session for async operations
- **`get_sync_db()`**: Sync session for legacy sync operations
- **Proper session cleanup**: Ensures connections are properly closed

### 3. Route Updates

Updated all route files to use the appropriate session type:

- **`api/routes/auth.py`**: Uses `get_sync_db()` for sync operations
- **`api/routes/app.py`**: Uses `get_sync_db()` for most operations, `get_db()` for async operations
- **`core/security.py`**: Uses `get_sync_db()` for user authentication

### 4. Application Startup (`main.py`)

- **Graceful database failure handling**: Application starts even if database is temporarily unavailable
- **Enhanced health check**: Includes database status information
- **Better logging**: More informative startup messages

### 5. Testing and Debugging

- **`test_db_connection.py`**: Standalone script to test database connectivity
- **Enhanced health endpoint**: `/health` now shows database status

## Configuration Changes

### Database Pool Settings
```python
# Before
pool_size=5
max_overflow=10

# After  
pool_size=3
max_overflow=5
pool_timeout=30
```

### Session Dependencies
```python
# For sync operations (legacy code)
from core.database import get_sync_db
db: Session = Depends(get_sync_db)

# For async operations (new code)
from core.database import get_db  
db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
```

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Endpoint
```
GET /health
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "She&Soul API", 
  "database": "healthy|unhealthy|error: message",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Database Test Script
```bash
python test_db_connection.py
```

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Monitor connection pool usage**: Watch for connection exhaustion
2. **Consider connection pooling service**: For high-traffic applications
3. **Implement circuit breaker**: For database failure scenarios
4. **Add metrics**: Track database performance and connection usage
5. **Gradual migration**: Consider migrating to full async patterns over time

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and test**: Verify fixes resolve the connection issues
2. **Monitor logs**: Watch for any remaining database errors
3. **Performance testing**: Ensure connection pool settings are optimal
4. **Consider async migration**: Plan gradual migration to async patterns for better performance
